The QEMU x86 emulator
---------------------

INSTALLATION
------------

Type 

    ./configure --interp-prefix=/usr/local/qemu-i386
    make

to build qemu and libqemu.a.

Type

    make install

to install QEMU in /usr/local/bin

* On x86 you should be able to launch any program by using the
libraries installed on your PC. For example:

    ./qemu -L / /bin/ls

* On non x86 CPUs, you need first to download at least an x86 glibc
(qemu-XXX-i386-glibc21.tar.gz on the qemu web page). Ensure that
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set:

    unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

Then you can launch the precompiled 'ls' x86 executable:

    ./qemu /usr/local/qemu-i386/bin/ls-i386

You can look at /usr/local/qemu-i386/bin/qemu-conf.sh so that QEMU is
automatically launched by the Linux kernel when you try to launch x86
executables.

Tested tool versions
--------------------

In order to compile QEMU succesfully, it is very important that you
have the right tools. The most important one is gcc. I cannot guaranty
that QEMU works if you do not use a tested gcc version. Look at
'configure' and 'Makefile' if you want to make a different gcc
version work.

[1] On Alpha, QEMU needs the gcc 'visibility' attribute only available
    for gcc version >= 3.3.
[2] Linux >= 2.4.20 is necessary for precise exception support
    (untested).
[3] 2.4.9-ac10-rmk2-np1-cerf2

[4] gcc 2.95.x generates invalid code when using too many register
variables. You must use gcc 3.x on PowerPC.
