The QEMU x86 emulator
---------------------

INSTALLATION
------------

Type 

    ./configure --interp-prefix=/usr/local/qemu-i386
    make

to build qemu and libqemu.a.

Type

    make install

to install QEMU in /usr/local/bin

* On x86 you should be able to launch any program by using the
libraries installed on your PC. For example:

    ./qemu -L / /bin/ls

* On non x86 CPUs, you need first to download at least an x86 glibc
(qemu-XXX-i386-glibc21.tar.gz on the qemu web page). Ensure that
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set:

    unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

Then you can launch the precompiled 'ls' x86 executable:

    ./qemu /usr/local/qemu-i386/bin/ls-i386

You can look at /usr/local/qemu-i386/bin/qemu-conf.sh so that QEMU is
automatically launched by the Linux kernel when you try to launch x86
executables.
