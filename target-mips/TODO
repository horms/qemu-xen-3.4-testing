Unsolved issues/bugs in the mips/mipsel backend
-----------------------------------------------

General
-------
- [ls][dw][lr] report broken (aligned) BadVAddr
- Missing per-CPU instruction decoding, currently all implemented
  instructions are regarded as valid
- Applications running on top of a emulated Linux segfault sometimes
  when the Qemu FPU emulation is disabled. Also gdb inside the emulated
  system does not work. Both problems are caused by insufficient
  handling of self-modifying code.

MIPS64
------
- No 64bit TLB support
- no 64bit wide registers for FPU
- 64bit mul/div handling broken

"Generic" 4Kc system emulation
------------------------------
- Doesn't correspond to any real hardware.

PICA 61 system emulation
------------------------
- No framebuffer support yet.

MALTA system emulation
----------------------
- We fake firmware support instead of doing the real thing
- Real firmware falls over when trying to init RAM, presumably due
  to lacking system controller emulation.
