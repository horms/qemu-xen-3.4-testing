Unsolved issues/bugs in the mips/mipsel backend
-----------------------------------------------

General
-------
- [ls][dw][lr] report broken (aligned) BadVAddr
- Missing per-CPU instruction decoding, currently all implemented
  instructions are regarded as valid
- Applications running on top of a emulated Linux segfault sometimes
  when the Qemu FPU emulation is disabled, the tb misses a flush
  in that case.
- gdb breakpoints inside the emulated system work only due to a hack
  which disassembles over the end of the current tb.
- Floating point results of ceil/floor/round are wrong for IEEE cornercases.
- recip/rsqrt FPU instructions are not implemented

MIPS64
------
- 64bit FPU enable flag not handled correctly

"Generic" 4Kc system emulation
------------------------------
- Doesn't correspond to any real hardware.

PICA 61 system emulation
------------------------
- No framebuffer support yet.

MALTA system emulation
----------------------
- We fake firmware support instead of doing the real thing
- Real firmware falls over when trying to init RAM, presumably due
  to lacking system controller emulation.
