Unsolved issues/bugs in the mips/mipsel backend
-----------------------------------------------

General
-------
- [ls][dw][lr] report broken (aligned) BadVAddr
- Missing per-CPU instruction decoding, currently all implemented
  instructions are regarded as valid
- pcnet32 does not work for little endian emulation on big endian host
  (probably not mips specific, but observable for mips-malta)

MIPS64
------
- No 64bit TLB support
- no 64bit wide registers for FPU
- 64bit mul/div handling broken
- DM[FT]C not implemented, M[FT]C does not cut sign extensions in all
  cases.

"Generic" 4Kc system emulation
------------------------------
- Doesn't correspond to any real hardware.

MALTA system emulation
----------------------
- We fake firmware support instead of doing the real thing
- Linux 2.4/2.6 Kernels receive spurious PIIX4 interrupts, noisy on 2.4,
  silent on 2.6, indicates some divergence from actual hardware.
