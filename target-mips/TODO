Unsolved issues/bugs in the mips/mipsel backend
-----------------------------------------------

General
-------
- [ls][dw][lr] report broken (aligned) BadVAddr

MIPS64
------
- Userland emulation (both n32 and n64) not functional.

"Generic" 4Kc system emulation
------------------------------
- Doesn't correspond to any real hardware.

PICA 61 system emulation
------------------------
- No framebuffer support yet.

MALTA system emulation
----------------------
- We fake firmware support instead of doing the real thing
- Real firmware falls over when trying to init RAM, presumably due
  to lacking system controller emulation.
