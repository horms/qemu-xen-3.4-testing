- optimize translated cache chaining (DLL PLT-like system)
- more syscalls (in particular all 64 bit ones, IPCs, fix 64 bit
  issues, fix 16 bit uid issues)
- finish signal handing (fp87 state, more siginfo conversions)
- verify thread support (clone() and various locks)
- vm86 syscall support
- overrides/16bit for string ops
- make it self runnable (use same trick as ld.so : include its own relocator and libc)
- improved 16 bit support 
- fix FPU exceptions (in particular: gen_op_fpush not before mem load)
