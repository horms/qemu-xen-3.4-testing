- fix gcc 2.96 compile bug 
- fix thread locks
- optimize translated cache chaining (DLL PLT-like system)
- fix thread stack freeing (use kernel 2.5.x CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID)
- fix x86 stack allocation
- fix iret/lret restarting
- more syscalls (in particular all 64 bit ones, IPCs, fix 64 bit
  issues, fix 16 bit uid issues)
- finish signal handing (fp87 state, more siginfo conversions)
- fix FPU exceptions (in particular: gen_op_fpush not before mem load)
- handle self-modifying code (track mmap and mark all pages containing
  translated code as readonly. use a custom signal handler to flush
  parts of the translation cache if write access to a readonly page
  containing translated code).
- use gcc to compile to static code
