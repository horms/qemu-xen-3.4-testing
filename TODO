- fix thread stack liberation (use kernel 2.5.xxx CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID)
- fix x86 stack allocation
- fix iret/lret restarting
- more syscalls (in particular all 64 bit ones, IPCs, fix 64 bit
  issues, fix 16 bit uid issues)
- finish signal handing (fp87 state, more siginfo conversions)
- verify thread support (clone() and various locks)
