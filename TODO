- daa/das
- optimize translated cache chaining (DLL PLT like system)
- segment ops (minimal LDT/GDT support for wine)
- improved 16 bit support 
- optimize inverse flags propagation (easy by generating intermediate
  micro operation array).
- signals
- threads
- make it self runnable (use same trick as ld.so : include its own relocator and libc)
- fix FPU exceptions (in particular: gen_op_fpush not before mem load)
- tests
